## Example 1: Basic Cost Aggregation

### üîç Natural Language Query
```
What is the total AWS cost?
```

### üîß Generated SQL
```sql
SELECT SUM(billedcost) as total_cost FROM aws_cost
```

### üìä Results
```json
{
  "total_cost": 45678.92
}
```

### üí¨ Natural Language Explanation
Based on your question 'What is the total AWS cost?', the total comes to **$45,678.92**. This represents the sum of all billed costs across all AWS services in your dataset.

### ‚úÖ Method Used
**Ollama (LLM-based)** - The engine successfully used the local Llama 3.2 model to interpret the intent and generate accurate SQL.

## Example 2: Grouped Analysis

### üîç Natural Language Query
```
Show me the top 5 services by cost
```

### üîß Generated SQL
```sql
SELECT servicename, SUM(billedcost) as total_cost 
FROM aws_cost 
GROUP BY servicename 
ORDER BY total_cost DESC 
LIMIT 5
```

### üìä Results
```json
[
  {"servicename": "Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud", "total_cost": 15234.56},
  {"servicename": "Amazon Simple Storage Service", "total_cost": 8765.43},
  {"servicename": "Amazon Relational Database Service", "total_cost": 6543.21},
  {"servicename": "Amazon Virtual Private Cloud", "total_cost": 3456.78},
  {"servicename": "AWS Lambda", "total_cost": 2345.67}
]
```

### üí¨ Natural Language Explanation
Based on your question 'Show me the top 5 services by cost', here are the top 5 results sorted by cost:

1. **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)**: $15,234.56 - Your highest cost service, representing compute infrastructure

FROM azure_cost
GROUP BY servicecategory
ORDER BY total_cost DESC
```

### üìä Results
```json
[
  {"servicecategory": "Compute", "total_cost": 12345.67, "record_count": 1523},

```

### üí¨ Natural Language Explanation
Based on your question 'Show me Azure costs grouped by service category', here's the breakdown:

**Cost by Service Category:**

1. **Compute** ($12,345.67 - 47.2%)
   - 1,523 billing records
   - Virtual machines, container instances, app services

FROM (
    SELECT billingperiodstart, billedcost 
    FROM aws_cost 
    WHERE servicecategory = 'Compute'
    UNION ALL
    SELECT billingperiodstart, billedcost 
    FROM azure_cost 
    WHERE servicecategory = 'Compute'
)
GROUP BY DATE(billingperiodstart)
ORDER BY billing_date DESC
LIMIT 30
```

### üìä Results

  {"billing_date": "2024-01-26", "daily_cost": 989.01}
  // ... more days
]
```

### üí¨ Natural Language Explanation
Based on your question 'What is the daily cost trend for compute services?', I analyzed the last 30 days of compute spending:

**Daily Compute Cost Trend:**
- **Average daily cost**: $1,002.34
- **Highest day**: Jan 27 at $1,034.56
- **Lowest day**: Jan 28 at $956.78
- **Variability**: ¬±4.2% (relatively stable)

**Trend Analysis:**
- Compute costs show consistent daily spending with minimal fluctuation
- Weekend costs slightly lower (10-15% reduction) suggesting development workloads
